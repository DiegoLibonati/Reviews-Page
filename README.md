## Description

I made a web page that allows you to see different reviews, this web application allowed me to learn how to make this kind of reviews/slides with next, prev and with a `Surprise Me` button that basically looks for a random review to show. In this case you see an image, the name, the role and a brief description. I use POO to build this.

## Feel free to edit my code

If you want to add any new information to the review you can do it here and then use it.

```
constructor(imagen, nombre, cargo, texto){
    this.imagen = imagen;
    this.nombre = nombre;
    this.cargo = cargo;
    this.texto = texto;
}
```

If you want to add a new revision you can do it, but be careful because you need to pass the attributes that are in the constructor

```
const review4 = new Reviews("IMAGE LINK", "Martinez Riq", "BACKEND DEVELOPER", "Air plant deep v polaroid church-key. Farm-to-table ramps put a bird on it pickled aesthetic pork belly beard tbh street art pabst. Pop-up cliche before they sold out hoodie heirloom flannel schlitz organic. Crucifix forage cardigan before they sold out umami echo park subway tile art party squid shoreditch photo booth.")
```
