# Reviews Page

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Join to the correct path of the clone
3. Execute: `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Execute: `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`

## Description

I made a web page that allows you to see different reviews, this web application allowed me to learn how to make this kind of reviews/slides with next, prev and with a `Surprise Me` button that basically looks for a random review to show. In this case you see an image, the name, the role and a brief description. I use POO to build this.

## Technologies used
